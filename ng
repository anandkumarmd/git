Bootstrap has three parts: 
The css, the icons, and a javascript file that has the more complicated controls (like popoups, dropdowns, etc). 
angular-ui-bootstrap angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap rewrites the javascript as angular directives but 
retains the original css and icons and does not include those files in its ditsribution. â€“

exec sequence


    ng-class - use when the set of CSS styles is static/known ahead of time
    ng-style - use when you can't define a CSS class because the style values may change dynamically. Think programmable control of the style values.
    ng-show and ng-hide - use if you only need to show or hide something (modifies CSS)
    ng-if - new in version 1.1.5, use instead of the more verbose ng-switch if you only need to check for a single condition (modifies DOM)
    ng-switch - use instead of using several mutually exclusive ng-shows (modifies DOM)
    ng-disabled and ng-readonly - use to restrict form element behavior
    ng-animate - new in version 1.1.4, use to add CSS3 transitions/animations
